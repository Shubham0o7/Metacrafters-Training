# Summer Program at Metacrafters

## Project Overview:
This summer program at Metacrafters provided an immersive learning experience in JavaScript and blockchain technology. Through a combination of theoretical concepts and hands-on projects, I gained a strong foundation in:

* **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Core concepts, data structures, and object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
* **Blockchain Technology:** Exploring the fundamentals of blockchain, including cryptography, consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake), and smart contracts.
* **Blockchain Platforms:** Working with popular blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Avalanche (Avax).

I worked on various projects during this programme. Please find the code, implementation and loom video explaining the projects in the metacrafters training folder in this directory.
